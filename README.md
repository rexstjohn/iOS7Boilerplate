iOS 7 APPLICATION BOILERPLATE

I wanted to produce a minimal iOS 7 networking application so people can have a starting point for a very basic API integration in iOS
including downloading data, putting it into a table etc.

Run "pod install" (requires MKNetworkKit). Was having problem with the MKNetworkKit pod not long ago so you may be better off
just downloading the MKNetworkKit dir and using that directly.
